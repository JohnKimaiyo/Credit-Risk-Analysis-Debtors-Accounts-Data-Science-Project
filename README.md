# Credit Risk Analysis Debtors Accounts


We analyze debtor payment behavior and determine which debtors should receive better due dates, we can use Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to perform this analysis:


Load the Data: Use pandas to load the data from the file.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, such as converting date columns to datetime objects and handling missing values.

Feature Engineering: Create new features that might be useful for analysis, such as the number of days between the invoice date and the maturity date.

Analyze Payment Behavior: Calculate metrics such as average payment delay, total amount owed, and frequency of late payments.

Cluster Analysis: Use clustering algorithms from scikit-learn to group debtors based on their payment behavior.

Determine Better Due Dates: Based on the analysis, suggest better due dates for debtors who frequently pay late.
